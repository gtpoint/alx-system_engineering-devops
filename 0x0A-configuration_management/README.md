# 0x0A Configuration Management

In this project, I started working with Puppet as a configuration management
tool.

## Tasks :

* **0. Create a file**
  * [0-create_a_file.pp](./0-create_a_file.pp): Puppet manifest file that
  creates a file `holberton` in the `/tmp` directory.
    * File permissions: `0744`.
    * File group: `www-data`.
    * File owner: `www-data`.
    * File content: `I love Puppet`.

* **1. Install a package**
  * [1-install_a_package.pp](./1-install_a_package.pp): Puppet manifest file
  that install puppet-lint version 2.1.1.

* **2. Execute a command**
  * [2-execute_a_command.pp](./2-execute_a_command.pp): Puppet manifest file
  that kills the process `killmenow`.
